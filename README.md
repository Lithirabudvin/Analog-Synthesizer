# Analog-Synthesizer
An analog synthesizer is an electronic instrument that generates and shapes sound using analog circuits like voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), filters (VCFs), and amplifiers (VCAs). Known for its warm, organic, and sometimes unpredictable tones, it creates rich basses, soaring leads, and evolving textures through hands-on control of knobs.
